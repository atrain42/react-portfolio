          <p>
            I am a self-taught, frontend developer who learned to code while
            working a full time job as a robotics engineer. I specialize in{" "}
            <span>CSS</span>, <span>JavaScript</span>, and <span>React</span>. I
            am always working on new projects and researching new topics.
            <br />
            <br />
            As mentioned above, before software development I was working as a
            robotic process engineer where I was programming robots to paint
            cars. I made the switch to software development because I have
            always enjoyed artwork and technology and I find that frontend
            development is the perfect way to combine both.
            <br />
            <br />
            What makes me a good software engineer is my attention to detail. I
            emphasize the small details when creating projects because I believe
            it greatly improves the user experience.
          </p>
