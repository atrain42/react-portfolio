        <p>
          I am a self-taught, frontend developer who learned to code while
          working a full time job as a robotics engineer. I specialize in{" "}
          <span>CSS</span>, <span>JavaScript</span>, and <span>React</span>. I
          am always working on new projects and researching new topics.
          <br />
          <br />
          As mentioned above, before software development I was working as a
          robotic process engineer where I was programming robots to paint cars.
          I made the switch to software development because I have always
          enjoyed artwork and technology and I find that frontend development is
          the perfect way to combine both.
          <br />
          <br />
          What makes me a good software engineer is my attention to detail. I
          emphasize the small details when creating projects because I believe
          it greatly improves the user experience.
